# CST-451-Senior-Project-1
This is my senior project for GCU CST-451 for Professor Jefferies. 
This contains all my given code and classes which are used for my social media platform application.
This project uses the elements of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and MySQL to make this full responsive application.
